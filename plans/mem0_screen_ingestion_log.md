## 2025-09-25 — Planning Mem0 screen ingestion initiative

**Participants:** GitHub Copilot (assistant), James (implicit requester)
**Duration:** 01:10 (est.)

### Summary

- Reviewed existing audit (`plans/mem0_audit_report.md`) and key source files (`mem0/memory/main.py`, `openmemory/api/app/routers/memories.py`, `openmemory/api/app/mcp_server.py`) to ground scope.
- Authored `mem0_screen_ingestion_spec.md` outlining architecture, data flow, and requirements for Windows-based screen ingestion feeding Mem0/OpenMemory.
- Produced actionable build plan (`mem0_screen_ingestion_build_plan.md`) with phase-based checkbox tasks covering capture agent, OCR, ingestion, testing, and packaging.

### Artifacts touched

- `plans/mem0_screen_ingestion_spec.md` — detailed specification.
- `plans/mem0_screen_ingestion_build_plan.md` — task checklist broken into phases.
- `plans/mem0_screen_ingestion_log.md` — work-session log scaffold (this file).

### Decisions & Blockers

- Decided to route ingestion through existing OpenMemory API/MCP stack instead of writing new MCP tooling, leveraging current `get_memory_client` integration.
- Identified need for local dedupe cache + Mem0’s built-in update cycle as combined mitigation for OCR repeat noise.
- No blockers discovered; implementation pending environment setup (OpenMemory + Qdrant + Gemini config).

### Next steps

- [ ] Execute Phase 0 tasks in `mem0_screen_ingestion_build_plan.md` to validate environment before coding.
- [ ] Begin Phase 1 by scaffolding capture agent package and configuration loader.
