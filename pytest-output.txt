        with this form.
    
        In the second form, the caller makes the division point clear through the
        provision of a single colon: the dotted name to the left of the colon is a
        package to be imported, and the dotted name to the right is the object
        hierarchy within that package. Only one import is needed in this form. If
        it ends with the colon, then a module object is returned.
    
        The function will return an object (which might be a module), or raise one
        of the following exceptions:
    
        ValueError - if `name` isn't in a recognised format
        ImportError - if an import failed when it shouldn't have
        AttributeError - if a failure occurred when traversing the object hierarchy
                         within the imported package to get to the desired object.
